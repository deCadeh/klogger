For my boys (and girls?) at SC2: a simple sample Windows keylogger. Core functionality only.

##Known issues
Outputs all printable characters in caps.

##Info
Runs as a process in the background. Will keylog to a file of your choice (specified in klogger.h). Source code divided as such because of the expectation of future added funtionality.

##Misc
Pronounced clogger.
