For my boys at the SC2: a simple sample Windows keylogger. Core functionality only.

## Known issues
- Outputs all printable characters in caps.

My first Windows program. If there are issues, let me know.

## Info
Runs as a process in the background (makes no other attempt to hide itself). Will keylog to a file of your choice (specified in klogger.h). Source code divided as such because of the expectation of future added funtionality.
